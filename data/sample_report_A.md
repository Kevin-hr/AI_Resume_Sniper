## 1. 🎯 Match Score (0-100)
**Score: 75**

**Rationale:** This is a competent resume that lands in the backup pile. The candidate has relevant B2B SaaS and AI product experience, and the STAR format is a plus. However, the resume fails to make an immediate, unambiguous connection to the *specific* requirements of the JD, requiring the screener to infer and connect the dots. It lacks the sharp, keyword-dense precision needed to guarantee a pass in a 6-second scan against a high-volume ATS.

## 2. 🚩 Fatal Red Flags (The "Why No")
1.  **Missing Explicit JD Keyword Match:** The resume uses "B2B SaaS" and "LLM," but the JD's critical phrases **"B端 SaaS"** and **"大模型 (LLM)"** are absent. For an ATS and a non-English-speaking HR screener, this is a direct mismatch. The term "B-End" is non-standard and weak.
2.  **Vague on Core JD Technology:** The JD explicitly requires familiarity with **"RAG, Fine-tuning, Prompt Engineering"**. The resume lists "RAG Architecture" and "Prompt Engineering" under skills, but the work experience bullet for "Contract AI" only mentions "RAG-based system" without detailing the candidate's *hands-on* involvement with these specific techniques, making their depth of understanding questionable.
3.  **Weak Quantification of "Success Case":** The JD prioritizes candidates with **"B 端 SaaS 成功案例"**. While the resume claims "generating over ¥5M in ARR" and "15 key enterprise accounts," it buries the *direct attribution* of this success to the candidate's specific actions. The link between their daily work and the commercial outcome is implied, not proven with ruthless clarity.

## 3. 💎 The "Money" Bullet Points (STAR Rewrite)
**Selected Experience:** Senior Product Manager | TechFlow Solutions (2021 - Present) - "Contract AI" Project.

**Rewritten Bullets (HR & ATS Optimized):**

*   **Situation & Task:** To address enterprise clients' inefficiency in manual legal contract review (averaging 4 hours per document), I was tasked with leading the **从 0 到 1 (0-to-1)** development of "Contract AI," a **B端 SaaS** product leveraging **大模型 (LLM)** and **RAG** technology to automate risk analysis.
*   **Action:** I authored the core PRD defining the **RAG** architecture and **Prompt Engineering** rules for consistent output. I conducted over 20 user interviews with legal teams to iteratively design the "One-Click Risk Detection" feature, and managed a cross-functional squad of 5 engineers and 2 designers through agile sprints to deliver the MVP.
*   **Result:** The product achieved **90% accuracy** in risk identification, **reducing average contract review time by 70%** (from 4 hrs to 1.2 hrs). This value proposition directly secured **15 enterprise contracts**, contributing **¥2.5M in first-year ARR** and establishing a **successful B端 SaaS case study** for the sales team.

## 4. 💡 Quick Fixes (Actionable Advice)
1.  **Mirror the JD Language Precisely:** In the "Target Role" and "Professional Summary," change "B-End SaaS" to **"B端 SaaS"**. In the skills and experience bullets, explicitly use the Chinese terms **"大模型 (LLM)"** and **"B端"** alongside their English equivalents. This is non-negotiable for ATS parsing and HR recognition.
2.  **Front-Load the "Success Case" Metric:** The first bullet of your professional summary must state: **"Delivered a successful B端 SaaS AI product case study, generating ¥2.5M ARR from 15 enterprise clients within the first year."** Move the value from the back (buried in a result) to the very front.
3.  **Quantify Your "Technical Understanding":** In the "Contract AI" action bullet, add a sub-bullet: **"Applied Fine-tuning principles to optimize the base LLM (DeepSeek-V3) for legal domain terminology, improving key metric accuracy by [X%]."** If you didn't do fine-tuning, specify your hands-on work with RAG or Prompt Engineering. Show you didn't just "coordinate," you *applied*.
